                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Shane. 21 years old and lives in Caloocan City. I am the only child growing up 
                    in a troubled family. My father and mother divorced when I was young, 
                    but this did not hinder me and my mother, but we worked even harder to improve. 
                    Even though the divorce of my father and mother had a big impact, it did not make me 
                    ready to continue my studies in the COMPUTER SCIENCE course.</p>
